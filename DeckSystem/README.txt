											A Standard 52-Card Deck System
							(Written in Java SE 7 using Eclipse and tested with Junit 4.)

This is a standard library. I have assumed some aspects of the card deck system,
written keeping object oriented principles and data structures in mind. 

I have used the following classes :
	Card
	Deck
	Player
	Helper
	Sets

Used ArrayLists to store cards as they are dynamic and allow access to all cards.
Not developed for a single game but was developed as a library that can be used to make card games
Tested a number of cases using Junit.
Also created a Test suite to run all the Junit tests
